# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository.

## What this is

A Home Assistant add-on that runs the **Claude Code CLI** in a browser terminal
(`ttyd` + `tmux`), with persistent package management. This repo is a fork of
[ESJavadex/claude-code-ha](https://github.com/ESJavadex/claude-code-ha) that
exists to fix three things that broke the upstream add-on:

1. **`statx` crash** — newer Claude native builds need the `statx` symbol, which
   Alpine 3.19 (musl 1.2.4) doesn't export. The add-on bricked on launch with
   `Error relocating ...: statx: symbol not found`. Fixed by moving the base
   image to **Alpine 3.21 (musl 1.2.5)**.
2. **Broken `persist-install`** — the copy logic mishandled apk file paths and
   missed shared-lib deps, so "installed" packages didn't actually persist.
3. **A dead persistent-Claude layer** — an obsolete `cli.js`-based path fought
   the baked binary. Removed; the baked, pinned binary is now authoritative.

## Repo layout

The add-on lives entirely in **`claude-terminal/`**:

- `Dockerfile` — image build; Claude pinned via `ARG CLAUDE_VERSION`.
- `build.yaml` — base images (Alpine 3.21 per-arch) + image labels.
- `config.yaml` — add-on manifest: options, schema, ingress, ports, version.
- `run.sh` — startup: launcher hardening, package auto-install, ttyd launch.
- `scripts/` — `persist-install` and helpers (auth, session picker, health).
- `image-service/` — Node service for image upload/paste.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — user-facing release notes.

Everything else at the repo root (`flake.nix`, `DEVELOPMENT*.md`, etc.) is dev
tooling and docs.

## The golden rule: how to ship a Claude Code update

This is the **only supported way** to update the Claude binary:

1. Bump `ARG CLAUDE_VERSION` in `claude-terminal/Dockerfile`.
2. Bump `version:` in `claude-terminal/config.yaml` (and the label in
   `build.yaml`).
3. Add a `claude-terminal/CHANGELOG.md` entry.
4. Commit, push, then **Update/Rebuild the add-on** from the HA add-on store.

Updates are delivered by **rebuilding the image**, not by updating inside the
container. `/data` is preserved across rebuilds, so this is non-destructive.

### Do NOT update Claude from inside the container

- `npm update -g` is a **no-op** — the install is the self-contained native
  binary, not an npm package.
- `claude update` "works" but **bricks the next launch**: it writes a new build
  into `/data` and repoints the launcher; if that build needs a symbol the base
  musl lacks, every subsequent launch dies. Auto-update is disabled
  (`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1`) for this reason — keep it that way.

`run.sh` defends against drift by **force-linking the launcher to the image's
baked binary on every boot** (`init_environment`), so any stray in-container
update self-heals on restart.

## Invariants — don't regress these

- **Base image must export `statx`.** Don't drop `build.yaml` below Alpine 3.21
  to chase a smaller image — you'll reintroduce the launch crash.
- **`ttyd` and `tmux` are baked in the Dockerfile**, not apk'd at runtime, so the
  terminal still starts when Alpine repos are unreachable. Keep them baked.
- **Reading a list option from `bashio`:** `bashio::config 'some_list'` already
  expands a list into newline-separated raw values. Do **not** pipe it back
  through `jq -r '.[]'` — that double-parses non-JSON and aborts with
  `jq: parse error: Invalid literal...`, silently installing nothing. Consume
  the lines directly. (This was the v3.0.1 fix.)

## persist-install (package persistence)

The container's apk/pip layer is **ephemeral** — `apk add` / `pip install` are
lost on restart. Use **`persist-install`**, which copies binaries and their
`ldd`-resolved libraries into `/data/packages/{bin,lib}` (and a Python venv),
which is on `PATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and survives restarts and recreation.

```bash
persist-install git tmux openssh-client      # apk packages
persist-install --python requests pandas      # pip into the venv
persist-install --list
```

Users can also auto-install on boot via the `persistent_apk_packages` /
`persistent_pip_packages` options (handled by `auto_install_packages` in
`run.sh`). Full details: `claude-terminal/PERSISTENT_PACKAGES.md`.

## Build & test locally

```bash
nix develop                 # dev shell (podman, hadolint); or `direnv allow`

# Build against the real base (note: 3.21, not 3.19)
podman build \
  --build-arg BUILD_FROM=ghcr.io/home-assistant/amd64-base:3.21 \
  -t local/claude-terminal:test ./claude-terminal

# Run, inspect, tear down
podman run -d --name cc-test -p 7681:7681 -v /tmp/cc-config:/config local/claude-terminal:test
podman logs -f cc-test
podman stop cc-test && podman rm cc-test

hadolint ./claude-terminal/Dockerfile
```

## Conventions

- **Every change bumps the version and adds a CHANGELOG entry** — together, in
  the same commit. The add-on store keys updates off `version:`.
- Add-on shell scripts use `#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bashio` and
  `bashio::log.*` for output; `persist-install` is plain `#!/bin/bash`.
- YAML: 2-space indent. Shell: 4-space indent.
- Prefer **baking** tools into the image over runtime `apk add` when they must be
  reliably present.

## Where the details live

The source is commented with the rationale for each fix — read it before
changing it: `build.yaml` (base/`statx`), `Dockerfile` (`CLAUDE_VERSION`),
`config.yaml` (options/schema), `run.sh` (launcher hardening, auto-install),
`scripts/persist-install` (copy + `ldd` dep resolution). Release history is in
`claude-terminal/CHANGELOG.md`.
